This repository contains **MySQL database schemas** for various projects, demonstrating Entity-Relationship (ER) modeling. 

Each schema is designed based on specific business requirements, including:

Optician Management System: Models customers, sales, glasses (with detailed attributes like prescription, frame type, and color), and supplier relationships.

Online Pizzeria Order System: Focuses on customer orders, diverse product types (pizzas, burgers, drinks), store management, and employee roles (cooks, delivery personnel).

Simplified YouTube Database: Illustrates user management, video uploads (with states, tags, and engagement metrics), channel creation, subscriptions, playlists, and comment functionalities.
